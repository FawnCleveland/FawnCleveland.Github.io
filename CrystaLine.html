            Tower Defense with a Twist
		</h4>
        <p>
            A common issue in the tower defense genre is routine.

			In a normal tower defense, you choose from a list of upgrades 
			for each unit. Even if you wanted to adapt to a situation, 
			you are discouraged because it's more efficient to just keep 
			upgrading what you already have than getting something else from scratch. 
			That is the problem I hope to solve with this game. I present,

		<p>
			All units are randomly generated. They have a random collection of moves, 
			all with a random collection of stats. In order to improve your units, 
			you roll 3 options for potential evolutions and have to decide 
			which will be the most beneficial to you.
