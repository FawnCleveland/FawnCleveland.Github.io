            Welcome to my project showcase! This is a small collection of my personal favorite projects I've worked on
        </p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Fawn Cleveland, a full stack Software and Game Developer. 
			I graduated near the end of 2019, so my whole career has been 
			a little all over the place. Despite getting bounced around, 
			my passion and goal in life has always been Game Development. 
			Games are the perfect mix of artistic skill and technical prowess. 
			The deeper personal engagement can create emotional intensity 
			rarely matched by other mediums.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			My positions at Fortem and Dealersocket were great opportunities to 
			expand my skillset and learn how to work in a professional environment. 
			In the short time I was at Fortem I had already taken over as the software 
			lead for a project, and then taught the rest of my team how to work with 
			the codebase and the language in which it was written.
